	<li>Analyse existing threats to vulnerable groups (e.g., children, seniors or victims of gender-based domestic violence), and how technologies have accentuated these.</li>
	<li>Design and implement tools to conduct medium and large scale analyses of usage of these technologies in the wild, with special focus on privacy invasive practices and bad security mechanism, and how these are abused by miscreants. </li>
	<li>Write up documents and technical reports on the findings.</li>
